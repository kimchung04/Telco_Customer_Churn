    -Telco Customer Churn

Our Mission:

Our topic is customer churn in the telecommunications industry. We chose this topic because it is a common problem faced by telecommunications companies, and we believe that our analysis could provide insights that could help companies reduce churn rates and improve customer retention. The Telcom Customer Churn dataset contains information about customers of a telecommunications company, including their demographics, services used, and whether they have churned (i.e., stopped using the company's services). The raw data contains 7,043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).

Our main research question is: What factors are related to customer churn in the telecommunications industry, and how can these factors be used to predict which customers are likely to churn in the future? To answer this question, we plan to conduct exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships in the data, and then develop and evaluate predictive models using machine learning techniques.

What is the top 3 most popular service that customer prefer to use?

How many of those who unsubscribed and still subscribe used the phone service?

Base on the information given, what is the percentage of people that will retain?

What is the best matrix method to use for this platform?

Could a model built on this dataset be used to predict churn in the future?
