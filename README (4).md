Our Mission

 Our topic is customer churn in the telecommunications industry. We chose this topic because it is a common problem faced by telecommunications companies, and we believe that our analysis could provide insights that could help companies reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.

 

 




## Description
The Telcom Customer Churn dataset contains information about customers of a telecommunications company, including their demographics, services used, and whether they have churned (i.e., stopped using the company's services). The raw data contains 7,043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).
## Quesitions
Our main research question is: What factors are related to customer churn in the telecommunications industry, and how can these factors be used to predict which customers are likely to churn in the future? To answer this question, we plan to conduct exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships in the data, and then develop and evaluate predictive models using machine learning techniques.
