The final project will consist of predicting whether or not this company can retain customers by providing substantial data. 

The presentation: Topic: Our topic is customer churn in the telecommunications industry. We chose this topic because it is a common problem faced by telecommunications companies, and we believe that our analysis could provide insights that could help companies reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.

Data description: The Telcom Customer Churn dataset includes information about customers' demographics, services used, and whether they have churned. There are 7,043 customers in the dataset, and each customer has 20 attributes.

Questions: Our main research question is: What factors are related to customer churn in the telecommunications industry, and how can these factors be used to predict which customers are likely to churn in the future? To answer this question, we plan to conduct exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships in the data, and then develop and evaluate predictive models using machine learning techniques.
