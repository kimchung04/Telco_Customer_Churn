# Telcom Customer Churn Project


## Dataset Description

The Telcom Customer Churn dataset contains information about customers of a telecommunications company, including their demographics, services used, and whether they have churned (i.e., stopped using the company's services). The raw data contains 7,043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).

## Database Schema

We have designed a database to store the Telcom Customer Churn dataset. The database has two tables: one for customer information and one for service information. The database schema is defined in the telcom_churn.sql file.

## Project Goals

Our goal is to explore factors that may be related to customer churn and develop predictive models to identify customers who are likely to churn in the future. To achieve this goal, we plan to:

 - Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis.
 - Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
 - Develop and evaluate predictive models using machine learning techniques.
 - Document our analysis and findings in a Jupyter notebook.
 - Present our results in a final presentation.
